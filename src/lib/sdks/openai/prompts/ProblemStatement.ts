const ProblemStatementMistakes = `
**Common Mistakes:**

Three common mistakes to avoid when crafting a problem statement are:

1. **Vagueness**: Using vague or ambiguous language that does not clearly define the problem or its impact on the target customers.

2. **Over-Complexity**: Including unnecessary details or information that distract from the core problem the company is trying to solve.

3. **Lack of Relevance**: Failing to align the problem statement with the company's target market or business goals, leading to misalignment in the product development process.

4. **Solution-centric Approach**: Describing solutions within the problem statement detracts from its purpose, leading to narrow-minded product development.

5. **Lack of Specificity**: Failing to clearly articulate the core problem and its impact on stakeholders results in vague and ineffective problem statements.

6. **Inclusion of Causes or Blame**: Blaming specific entities or focusing on underlying causes distracts from the immediate problem, hindering innovation.

7. **Overlooking Human Element**: Neglecting to connect the problem statement to the human experience diminishes its relatability and significance.

By avoiding these mistakes, you can ensure that your problem statement is clear, concise, and actionable, setting the stage for a successful product development process.
