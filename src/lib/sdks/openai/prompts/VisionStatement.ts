**Definition:**

**Vision Statement**: A vision statement outlines the long-term aspirations and goals of the organization. It communicates the desired future state and serves as a guiding light for strategic decision-making. Vision statements are inspirational and aspirational, motivating stakeholders and guiding the organization's direction.

**Mission Statement**: A mission statement describes the fundamental purpose and activities of the organization. It defines what the organization does, who it serves, and how it serves them. Mission statements provide clarity and focus, guiding day-to-day operations and ensuring alignment with the organization's core values and objectives.

**Difference**: While both vision and mission statements are essential for an organization, they serve different purposes:

1. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term**: Vision statements focus on the long-term aspirations and goals of the organization, providing a clear picture of the desired future state. Mission statements, on the other hand, describe the fundamental purpose and activities of the organization in the present, guiding day-to-day operations.

2. **Aspiration vs. Action**: Vision statements are aspirational and inspirational, motivating stakeholders and guiding strategic decision-making. Mission statements, on the other hand, are action-oriented, defining what the organization does, who it serves, and how it serves them.

3. **Direction vs. Operations**: Vision statements provide direction and guidance for the organization's future, serving as a guiding light for strategic planning. Mission statements provide clarity and focus for day-to-day operations, ensuring alignment with the organization's core purpose and values.

Three common mistakes with mission statements and vision statements
Crafting a concise, clear, and memorable vision statement and mission statement is difficult, and a major creative challenge early in the startup cycle. Avoid these three common mistakes to develop compelling statements:

1) The statements don't inspire.
While one of the main goals of the mission statement is to highlight what your business does, if it reads like a fact sheet line item, it's not going to be particularly effective. You can only inspire with evocative language and unexpected word choices based on soulful introspection, not by regurgitating dry, textbook-like information. Your vision statement in particular needs to capture the imagination of every employee who joins your organization. A vision statement that falls flat won't motivate and excite employees in their everyday work.

2) They lack personality and humanity.
The most effective vision statements and mission statements convey a sense of an organization's values—not only by capturing its raison d'être, but also its strategic priorities and personality. Again, word choice matters hugely. You have an opportunity to overturn expectations and set yourself apart from competitors through the language you select. Consider outdoor apparel company Patagonia's mission statement—”We're in business to save our home planet”—that is a very clear expression of its values and environment-first philosophy.

Your vision and mission also hand you an opportunity to project a sense of humanity—particularly through your vision statement. Why does your work matter to people, potentially around the world? How will it improve the quality of their lives? By weaving these elements into your statements, you generate an impression of considering and caring for the role your business plays in people's lives.

In both cases, it's essential for your statements to be genuine. Mimicking other organization's vision or mission, or feigning a personality never works—audiences will see right through it when their experience does not live up to the promise.

3) They use buzzwords and jargon.
This is particularly relevant to buzzword-heavy sectors like IT. Cut all jargon from your vision and mission. Use plain English at all times. These statements need to be completely accessible and comprehensible from anyone who reads them, regardless of their familiarity with the sector or products that you're looking to sell.
