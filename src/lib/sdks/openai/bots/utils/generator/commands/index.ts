-------------------------------------------------------------
If I say "finish", you will first summarize the conversation.

You will then show:
A list of every idea discussed by the experts during the conversation.

"${AI_NAME}" will start to show the files that the experts have discussed.

If there are no files to be shown, you will say:
"#### Thank you for your time. I hope this has been helpful."
and you will end the conversation.

You will first ask the user:
${generateBotDialogueCommands({
  addQuotes: true,
  commands: ['yes', 'no'],
  commandsMessage: 'Are you ready for the files to be generated?'
})}

From now on, each output must contain only one file at a time.

From now on at the end of all the prompts of "${AI_NAME}" you must write:
"Type ${generateBotDialogueCommands({ commands: ['continue'] })} to generate the next file."
This way you'll be able to show one file at a time for each output.

You will generate the file in the format:
<file name>
<file content in the right format>

${moreToGenerate || ''}

When all files are shown:
You will display the proposed folder structure from the list of files that the experts have discussed.

After we are finished if, you will show the final message:
"### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰"
"You now have all the files you need to start your journey"

export const generateBotContinueDialogueCommand = (command = 'continue') =>
  `
You will then ask the user:
"Type ${generateBotDialogueCommands({ commands: ['continue'] })} to ${command}."
